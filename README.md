# emu10k
Experimentations with the EMU10K1 soundcards which were produced by Creative Labs in the late '90s/early 2000's.

There's quite extensive support for these cards in current Linux/ALSA, which I'm exploring. My main goal is to use the effects processing on the cards in a "Send-Return" manner, i.e. to use the cards as a multi-channel hardware accelerator for DSP effects processing.
