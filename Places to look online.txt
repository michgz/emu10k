KxProject:

https://github.com/kxproject/kx-audio-driver                (open source re-implementation of Windows driver)
https://github.com/kxproject/kX-Audio-driver-Documentation  (has loads of documentation from Creative & others)




EMU Tools (AS10K1 & FV10K1):

https://sourceforge.net/projects/emu10k1/files/emu-tools/
     - as10k1 appears to have been fully merged into ALSA project, but other stuff here
        could be interesting
   (Note: I've mirrored this at https://github.com/michgz/emu10k1-tools/  - possibly will develop further)



Other docs related to EMU10K1 online:

https://emu10k1.tripod.com/_index.htm    (Not updated since 2001, but may be some things of interest remaining? "Links" page is pretty much all dead)
https://emu10k1.tripod.com/hardware.htm  (Patent from Creative. Unfortunately Mr. X's analysis seems to have got lost with time)

  (Note: this site mentions a "AS10K1" site by Daniel Bertrand. Has all of that information been subsumed into the "EMU Tools" repository?)
